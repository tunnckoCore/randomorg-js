## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
$ npm install randomorg-js --save
```

or install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
$ yarn add randomorg-js
```

Or in the browser directly using the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/randomorg-js/dist/randomorg.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var randomorg = RandomOrg
  console.log(randomorg)
  console.log(randomorg.generateIntegers)

  // see more below in that README
</script>
```

_Please don't use the `https://unpkg.com/randomorg-js` shortcut that Unpkg allows you, because it will give you the CommonJS / Nodejs (with `module.exports`) build, that you can't use in the browser._

## Usage
> For more use-cases see the [tests](test.js)

All methods from the [API documentation](https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/) - both ["Basic Methods"](https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/basic) and ["Digital Signing"](https://api.random.org/json-rpc/1/signing) -  are exposed as named exports. In addition, it also has `request` method, which has signature `(methodName, params, callback)` and one `RandomOrg` function which has `(id)` signature and it returns an object with same methods.

**ES6**

Each method has `(id, params, callback)` signature, where `id` is optional.

```js
import {
  generateIntegers,
  generateDecimalFractions,
  generateGaussians,
  generateStrings,
  generateUUIDs,
  generateBlobs,
  getUsage,
  generateSignedIntegers,
  generateSignedDecimalFractions,
  generateSignedGaussians,
  generateSignedStrings,
  generateSignedUUIDs,
  generateSignedBlobs,
  verifySignature,

  // special
  request,
  RandomOrg
} from 'randomorg-js'
```

**CommonJS / Node.JS**

Notice that Node > 4 is required for `destructing` feature.

```js
const {
  generateIntegers,
  generateDecimalFractions,
  generateGaussians,
  generateStrings,
  // ...
  generateSignedBlobs,
  verifySignature,

  // special
  request,
  RandomOrg
} = require('randomorg-js')
```

So you simply can just use old way

```js
var randomorg = require('randomorg-js')

console.log(randomorg)
console.log(randomorg.generateIntegers)
console.log(randomorg.generateDecimalFractions)
console.log(randomorg.verifySignature)
console.log(randomorg.request)
console.log(randomorg.RandomOrg)
// and etc.
```

**Example**

```js
const params = {
  apiKey: 'your api key',
  n: 6,
  min: 1,
  max: 6
}

generateIntegers(params, (err, response) => {
  // there may have `err` or `response.error`
  console.log(err || response.error)

  // response is exactly what the API spec
  // defines as response object
  console.log(response)
  console.log(response.id)
  console.log(response.result)
})
```

Or using the `request` method

```js
request('generateSignedStrings', {
  n: 8,
  length: 10,
  characters: 'ab!~cdefg+_-hijk@lmn#$%opqr^stuvwxyz',
}, (err, response) => {
  console.log(err, response)
})
```

By default the package exports all methods with randomly generated `id`. To change that, the onoe way can be to add `id` as first argument to each method e.g. `generateStrings(id, params, callback)`; or the second variant is to call the `RandomOrg(id)` which returns the same methods and they will use the defined `id` from the constructor.

```js
const { RandomOrg } = require('randomorg-js')

const random = RandomOrg(123555)

random.generateSignedBlobs({
 apiKey: 'your api key here',
 and: 'other params for that method'
}, (er, { id, result }) => {
  // response always has the same ID what
  // user has provided
  console.log(id) // => 123555
  console.log(result) // => random Signed Blobs
})

// but you still can provide
// different `id` to same method
random.generateSignedBlobs(4444, params, (e, { id }) => {
  console.log(id) // => 4444
})

// or to some other method
random.generateIntegers(2938742, params, (e, { id }) => {
  console.log(id) // => 2938742
})
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/randomorg-js/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
